# TF_Object_Detection2020




I'm currently working on a research project for my univeristy that requires object detection. I was following along with sentdex's tutorial on YouTube, but many things have changed since then and lots of work arounds are needed for it to function. This repository is the work I've done so far to make it work in 2020. There are many things in here that are outdated - even for tensorflow 1.x.x, but I wanted to keep it as close to the tutorial as posssible.
